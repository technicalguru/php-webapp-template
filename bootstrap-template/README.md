# Bootstrap Template

It is based on a classic Bootstrap layout with a dark navigation bar (sticky at top) in classic standard Bootstrap colors. However you can subclass the DefaultLayout to achieve your own layout version or add CSS files to change the color schemes.

Do not forget to check `application.php`, `index.php` and `.htaccess` whether they suit your needs.
