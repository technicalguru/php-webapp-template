# php-webapp-template
Template application for the php-webapp framework

Clone or download this project and copy one of the templates as the starting point
of your own application.

Remember: [technicalguru/webapp](https://github.com/technicalguru/php-webapp) is a framework to ease
and speed up your development of a new website. It cannot solve all your problems but is a
good starting point.

## Bootstrap template
This is currently the only template here. It is based on a classic Bootstrap layout with
a dark navigation bar (sticky at top) in classic standard Bootstrap colors. However you can subclass
the DefaultLayout to achieve your own layout version or add CSS files to change the color schemes.
